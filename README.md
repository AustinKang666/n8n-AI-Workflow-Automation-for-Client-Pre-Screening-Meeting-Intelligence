# ðŸ¤– n8n AI Workflow Automation  
Client Pre-Screening & Meeting Intelligence

This repository contains three n8n workflows designed to automate a full client interaction pipeline using AI agents, RAG database, smart email responses, and meeting preparation intelligence.

## ðŸ”§ Overview

This project uses n8n to orchestrate:

- **RAG Database Construction** â€” Convert internal PDFs into a vector store for document-grounded responses
- **Client Budget Filtering** â€” Classify form submissions based on client budget to determine follow-up strategy
- **Smart Email Responses** â€” Generate AI replies and auto-embed Cal.com meeting links
- **Webhook Triggered Summary** â€” Analyze client intent using Tavily Web Search and send pre-meeting briefings
